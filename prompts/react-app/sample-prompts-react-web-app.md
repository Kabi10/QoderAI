## Detailed Implementation Instructions

### 1. Project Structure
Generate a complete project with the following structure:
```
TaskMaster Pro/
├── src/
│   ├── components/           # Reusable UI components
│   ├── pages/               # Page-level components
│   ├── hooks/               # Custom React hooks
│   ├── store/               # Redux store configuration
│   ├── types/               # TypeScript type definitions
│   ├── utils/               # Utility functions
│   ├── styles/              # CSS/SCSS stylesheets
│   ├── App.tsx
│   └── index.tsx
├── public/
│   ├── index.html
│   └── favicon.ico
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
├── .gitignore
└── README.md
```

### 2. Package.json Configuration
Include the following dependencies:
- React ^18.2.0 and React DOM
- TypeScript and @types packages
- React Router DOM ^6.8.1
- @reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux
- Development tools: ESLint, Prettier, testing libraries

### 3. Core Components

#### App Component
Create the main App component with:
- React Router setup with navigation
- Redux Provider wrapper
- Error boundary implementation
- Main layout structure

#### Page Components
Generate the following pages:
- **Home Page**: Welcome screen with project overview
- **About Page**: Information about the application
- **Dashboard**: Main functional interface with data display

#### UI Components
Create reusable components:
- Header with navigation
- Footer with project information
- Loading spinner
- Error message display
- Button variants (primary, secondary)

### 4. Styling Requirements
- Use CSS Modules or styled-components for component styling
- Implement responsive breakpoints: mobile (320px+), tablet (768px+), desktop (1024px+)
- Create a consistent color scheme and typography system
- Ensure accessibility with proper contrast ratios and ARIA labels

### 5. State Management
Set up Redux Toolkit with:
- Configure store with proper middleware
- Create feature-based slices for different data domains
- Implement async thunks for API calls
- Add Redux DevTools integration for development

### 6. Development Configuration
- Configure ESLint with React and TypeScript rules
- Set up Prettier for consistent code formatting
- Add pre-commit hooks with Husky and lint-staged
- Configure VS Code settings for optimal development experience

### 7. Testing Setup
- Configure Jest and React Testing Library
- Create test utilities and custom render functions
- Write unit tests for all components
- Add integration tests for key user flows
- Set up test coverage reporting

### 8. Performance Optimization
- Implement React.memo for component optimization
- Use React.lazy for code splitting
- Optimize bundle size with proper imports
- Add performance monitoring and metrics

## Constraints and Considerations
- Mobile-first design
- WCAG accessibility compliance

## Success Criteria
The generated application should:
1. ✅ Compile without errors in both development and production modes
2. ✅ Pass all linting and type checking
3. ✅ Have responsive design that works on all device sizes
4. ✅ Include comprehensive error handling
5. ✅ Follow React best practices and patterns
6. ✅ Be ready for immediate deployment to Vercel
7. ✅ Include complete documentation and setup instructions

## Additional Notes
- Generate complete, production-ready code - not just boilerplate
- Include helpful comments explaining complex logic
- Follow naming conventions: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions
- Ensure all imports are properly typed and organized
- Add PropTypes or TypeScript interfaces for all component props
